This is a doctest based regression suite for 2-matrix_divided.py
Each '>>>' line is run as if in a python shell, and counts as a test.
The next line, if not '>>>' is the expected output of the previous line.
If anything doesn't match exactly (including trailing spaces), the test fails.

>>> matrix =  __import__("2-matrix_divided").matrix_divided

>>> matrix = [
... [1, 2, 3],
... [4, 5, 6]
... ]
>>> print(matrix)
[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
