This is a doctest based regression suite for 2-matrix_divided.py
Each '>>>' line is run as if in a python shell, and counts as a test.
The next line, if not '>>>' is the expected output of the previous line.
If anything doesn't match exactly (including trailing spaces), the test fails.

======================

Using ``matrix_divided``
-------------------

import module:
>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

>>> matrix = [
... [1, 2, 3],
... [4, 5, 6]
... ]
>>> print(matrix)
[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
>>> matrix = [
...     [1, 2, 3],
...     [4, 5, 6]
... ]
>>> matrix = [
...     "i'm not a list here",
...     [4, 5, 6, 10]
... ]
>>> matrix = [
...     [1, "i'm not int", 3],
...     [4, 5, 6]
... ]
